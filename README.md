# NOTE: THIS REPO IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED

Dotfiles - configuration files which are traditionally stored in files/folders whose filename starts with a dot (.config) - from the arch wiki.

The original waybar config is made by Anik200 - https://github.com/Anik200/dotfiles/tree/super-waybar.

# The configuration files for my laptop:

List of technologies:
- Neovim - extensible command line text editor, the config file includes plugins and themes (some of which aren't in use, and are commented out (screenshot 2),
- Hyprland - highly customizable window tiler; automatically divides windows into perfect sections (shown in screenshots),
- Hyprpaper - part of the hypr ecosystem, a background wallpaper daemon,
- Waybar - again, a customizable bar (you see the pattern by now?),
- Rofi - a light application launcher (activated with meta+space),
- Kitty - terminal emulator (screenshot 2-3),
- Fastfetch - just shows specs and info (screenshot 3),
- zsh - command line shell, if you use bash, you'll have to figure out how to make p10k work (maybe I'll work with bash, idrk),
- p10k - command line plugin for aesthetics (responsible for the coloured status bar on the third screenshot, the bar is on either sides of the cursor),

Required fonts:
JetBrains Mono 
JetBrains Mono Nerd

To download all of the dependencies:
`sudo pacman -S nvim hyprland hyprpaper waybar rofi fastfetch zsh ttf-jetbrains-mono ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd`
*then manually install the fonts in [.config/waybar/fonts/]*
- On linux, copy the fonts over to their respective directory:
/usr/local/share/fonts/(otf/ttc/ttf)/
